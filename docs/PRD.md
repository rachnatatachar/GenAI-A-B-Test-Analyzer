# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Name: GenAI-Powered A/B Test Analyzer <br>
Owner: Rachna Tatachar <br>
Date: May 18, 2025 <br>

## 1. Overview
This project aims to simplify the interpretation of A/B test results by combining statistical rigor with Generative AI. The tool will allow users to upload A/B test data, analyze statistical significance, and generate plain-English summaries using LLMs. The target audience includes product managers, analysts, and growth teams looking to quickly understand experimental results without deep statistical knowledge.

## 2. Goals
 - Automate statistical analysis of A/B test results
 - Provide clear, actionable insights using GenAI (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4)
 - Help users make decisions faster without needing data science resources

## 3. Target Users
 - Product Managers running experiments
 - Marketing/Growth teams testing campaigns
 - Analysts seeking automated experiment summaries
 - Founders at early-stage startups

## 4. Features (MVP Scope)
| Feature              | Description                                            | Priority |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| CSV Upload           | Upload a CSV with A/B test data                        | High     |
| Statistical Analysis | Calculate p-values, significance, confidence intervals | High     |
| GenAI Summary        | Generate plain-English summaries using GPT             | High     |
| Basic UI             | Streamlit or Flask interface to upload/view results    | Medium   |
| Downloadable Report  | Option to export results as Markdown or PDF            | Medium   |

## 5. Sample Use Case (User Flow)
 - User visits the app interface
 - Uploads a CSV file with test data (e.g., conversions for Group A & B)
 - App calculates significance metrics (e.g., p-value, lift)
 - App uses OpenAI to summarize results in plain language
 - User can copy or download the summary for stakeholder report

## 6. Success Metrics
 - Correct identification of test winners (based on statistical thresholds)
 - LLM-generated summary matches key insights
 - Users can interpret the result without needing explanation
 - Time to insight reduced compared to manual analysis

## 7. Tech Stack
 - Python (pandas, scipy/statsmodels)
 - OpenAI GPT API (text-davinci or gpt-4)
 - Streamlit or Flask for UI
 - Plotly or Matplotlib for charts (optional)
 - GitHub for version control

## 8. Out of Scope (For MVP)
 - Multivariate tests
 - Real-time dashboards
 - Full user management / login
 - API integrations with external tools (e.g., GA4, Mixpanel)

## 9. Future Roadmap
 - Support for cohort-based insights
 - Slack/email summaries
 - Support for continuous experiments
 - Auto-tagging of experiment metadata
 - Prompt tuning for better domain-specific summaries
